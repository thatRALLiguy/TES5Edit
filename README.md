# xEdit - dwnfdrknss edition

An independent fork of [xEdit](https://github.com/TES5Edit/TES5Edit), the Bethesda
plugin editor and conflict-resolution tool created by ElminsterAU and developed
by the upstream contributors credited below.

We are updating and customizing our own modding tools, with **Starfield as the
current focus**: investigating and fixing plugin bugs, testing changes, creating
new mods, and supporting game- and save-related troubleshooting. Skyrim and
Fallout 4 remain part of the broader toolset and are areas we may revisit as
this work develops.

This is an ongoing development fork. xEdit works on game plugins; direct
save-file repair requires separate tools.

## Releases

The links below are upstream xEdit releases. Custom work in this fork is
developed separately; these links do not distribute the dwnfdrknss edition.

The most recent builds are available through the [xEdit Discord](https://discord.com/invite/5t8RnNQ) in the `#xedit-builds` channel. The archive provided here is generic and works with all current game modes. See the [xEdit Versions](#xedit-versions) table in this document on how to properly use it.

## User Documentation

### xEdit Cleaning Guide

With the 4.0 update, all previous guides are obsolete. Refer to [xEdit Quick Auto Clean](https://tes5edit.github.io/docs/7-mod-cleaning-and-error-checking.html#ThreeEasyStepstocleanMods).

### Manuals

- [Fallout3 Training Manual](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/8629) for FO3Edit (applies to all game versions)
- [Fallout New Vegas Training Manual](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/38413) for FO3Edit (applies to all game versions)

### Online Documentation

EpFwip started an HTML conversion of the Fallout 3 Training Manual many years ago. With the help of GhPages and Jekyll online documentation for xEdit is now available. New screenshots of the Fallout 3 examples that Miax and JustinOther presented will be added as time permits. Also, the website will continue to evolve over time.

However, for now consider what the Tome of xEdit presents as a current resource for xEdit functionality. The previous PDF file presented step-by-step illustrations of the built-in functions available to xEdit. While the UI itself has had few changes over time the functions work the same and only certain functions are game-specific.

The online documentation is available from the Help button built into the developmental version of xEdit or you can view it [from here](https://tes5edit.github.io/docs/).

## Developer Documentation

Getting started with xEdit development requires a properly configured Delphi environment. The following instructions should get you through the minimal viable setup.

### Install Delphi

If you don't already have a Delphi environment, we recommend using [Delphi 12 Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter).

For this fork with Delphi 13, initialize the pinned submodules, then run
`powershell -File .\Tools\Prepare-Delphi13.ps1` from the repository root before
opening the IDE. This applies the reviewed compatibility patches for SynEdit,
JVCL, JCL, VirtualTrees, vcl-styles-utils, ImagingLib, lz4-delphi and
libdeflate-pas, and creates missing JCL configuration files from the upstream
template. Patches are kept in `Tools/compatibility`; the affected submodules
will show local modifications while they are applied. Their original pinned
commits are retained. The script can be rerun and refuses unexpected dependency
revisions. Run `python Tests/delphi13_patches.py` to verify that the patches
reproduce the modified dependency sources.
Compile through the Community Edition IDE.

The current build is not release-validated. A script that copies a populated
`TSearchRec` still fails with an invalid-pointer error. See
[IMPROVEMENTS.md](IMPROVEMENTS.md) for completed checks and remaining release
gates; clean compiler diagnostics do not establish runtime or gameplay safety.

### Install Dependencies

- Download and install [Project Magician](https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/downloads/download-info/project-magician/).
- Download and install [DDevExtensions](https://github.com/DelphiPraxis/DDevExtensions/releases).
- Launch Delphi and navigate to Tools &rarr; DDevExtensions Options.
- Under Extended IDE Settings, 
  - **enable** the _Disable Package Cache_ option.
- Under Form Designer,
  - **enable** the _Do not store the Explicit properties into the DFM_ option.
- Exit Delphi.
- Clone the xEdit repo (if you haven't already) and initialize submodules (run `git submodule update --init --recursive` from the git root).
- Navigate to the _External\jcl\jcl\source\include\\_ directory and copy **jcl.template.inc** to **jcld29win32.inc**. To build xEdit 64 bit, copy **jcl.template.inc** again, to **jcld29win64.inc**
- Open _External\jcl\jcl\packages\JclPackagesD290.groupproj_.
- Build All, then install all packages (non-runtime packages with green icons).
- Restart Delphi.
- Open _External\jvcl\jvcl\packages\D29 Packages.groupproj_.
- Navigate to Tools &rarr; Options.
- Under Language &rarr; Delphi, add the below paths to the _Library_ option:
  - _{TES5Edit repo}\External\jcl\jcl\lib\d29\win32_
  - _{TES5Edit repo}\External\jcl\jcl\source\include_
- Build All, then install all packages (non-runtime packages with green icons).
- Restart Delphi.
- Navigate to Tools &rarr; Options.
- Under Language &rarr; Delphi, add the below path to the _Library_ option:
  - _{TES5Edit repo}\External\jvcl\jvcl\lib\d29\win32_
- Restart Delphi.
- Open _External\VirtualTrees\Packages\RAD Studio 12\VirtualTreeView.groupproj_.
- Build All, then install **VirtualTreesD29.bpl**.
- Open _External\FileContainer\FileContainer29.groupproj_.
- Build All, then install **FileContainerD29.bpl**.

### Important Note

If you don't have commercial [DevExpress](https://www.devexpress.com/) components, you'll need to open _BethWorkBench.groupproj_ and ensure the Build Configuration is set to `LiteDebug`.

## xEdit Updates

With each new version of xEdit, it is recommended to restore plugins from backups and reclean them. Otherwise, any fixes and updates to the cleaning process won't take effect.
